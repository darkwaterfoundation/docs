# Welcome to Dark Water

This guide will help you get your hardware set up, connected, and working quickly and easily.

So, let's get going - follow the links for your board below

## The 640 board

The 640 (Six for Zero) board is a DC and Stepper motor control board capable of powering 6 independent DC motors (from 2 – 11v) or 3 stepper motors.

## The ESCAPE board

The ESCAPE (ESC-cape) board was designed to provide a method of using brushless motors rather than the DC motors.

## The SOAR board

The SOAR board is a holder for advanced sensors. It is ideal for use with different robot control boards, or if you have a single sensor expansion board you want to switch between robots.
