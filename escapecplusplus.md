# Programming the ESCAPE

## C++

### Introduction

The C++ libraries for the ESCAPE board and some example scripts are available via our GitHub repository. To install them open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi (unless you are running with only the command line) and enter the following:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/darkwaterfoundation/darkwater_cplus_escape.git
```

Once they are download we can navigate into the new directory and take a look around - so enter:

``` bash
$ cd ./darkwater_cplus_escape
```

Let's list the contents of that new directory by typing

``` bash
$ ls -al
```

You should see two directories (and a README.md file which contains this content), called **darkwater** and **examples**. 

The **darkwater** directory contains all of the classes needed to control your board and the **examples** directory contains a selection of demo code we've put together to show you how they are used.

#### Examples

Take a look in the examples directory and you will see the following available demos.

##### Motor

##### Servo

##### PPM

##### AccelGyroMag

### Drive a motor
### Motor speed
### Servo control
### PPM integration
