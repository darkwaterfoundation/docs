# Introduction

The 640 board is used to drive up to 6 DC motors and 2 Servo motors.

# Programming the 640

## Python

### Introduction

The Python libraries for the 640 board and some example scripts are available via our GitHub repository. To install them open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi (unless you are running with only the command line) and enter the following:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/darkwaterfoundation/darkwater_python_640.git
```

### Example scripts

Now that you have downloaded the 640 libraries you should have a new directory called *darkwater_python_640, so let's move into that directory

``` bash
$ cd ./darkwater_python_640
```

If you list the files in this directory, you should see a few test scripts

``` bash
$ ls -al
```

#### 640motortest.py

This script will start each motor port, in the forwards direction, in turn from left to right and then do the same backwards. To run the script enter the following:

``` bash
$ python 640motortest.py
```

#### 640servotest.py

This script will move any servos connected to the servo headers left, then center, then right. To run the script enter the following:

``` bash
$ python 640servotest.py
```

#### 640steppertest.py

This script divides the 6 motor ports into 3 stepper motor ports. Motor 1 and 2 will be stepper 1, motor 3 and 4 will be stepper 2 and motor 5 and 6 will be stepper 3.

Each stepper will be moved forwards and backwards through 200 steps when the test script is run:

``` bash
$ python 640steppertest.py
```

### The 640 board API

Now you know everything works, it's time to write your own scripts. So create a new python script in your editor, within the *darkwater_python_640* directory with a memorable name and add the following lines to import our libraries:

``` python
import time
from darkwater_640.darkwater_640 import dw_Controller, dw_Motor, dw_Servo
```

#### Create a controller

The **dw_controller** object controls access to all the elements on the 640 board, so the first thing we need to do is create a controller - we pass in the address of the 640 board as a parameter - the default address is 0x60

``` python
dw = dw_Controller( addr=0x60 )
```

Now that we have the controller created, we can access all the connectors on the board.

#### Select a Motor

There are 6 motor ports on the 640 board numbered 1 to 6 from left to right (with the ports facing you ).

If we want to control a motor on port number 1 then we need to request the motor object for that port from our controller - this is very easily done with a single line

``` python
m1 = dw.getMotor(1)
```
